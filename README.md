# Self-Driving-Car-Controller
# Self Driving Cars Longitudinal and Lateral Control Design
This project implements a controller in Python which is used to drive a car autonomously around a track in Carla Simulator.



Since the controller reference contains both position and speed, we need to implement both Longitudinal and Lateral Control.

The output of the controller will be the vehicle throttle, brake and steering angle commands.

The throttle and brake come from the Longitudinal speed control and the steering comes from our Lateral Control.

If you want to make your own controller design, I highly recommend that you should consider the following points:
